# Lime
**6.25:1 Single gear direct drive extruder compatible with Sherpa Mini mounting holes** 
---
Lime is a super compact & simple extruder. The gears are from the DXC extruder from Phaetus.

It's so simple that there are ony 3 parts to print, and non of them require supports.

Feel free to make modifications to this design.
